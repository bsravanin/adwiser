<p>Forget movies. I am going to use my pocket money to buy Max Payne 3. Payne's new look is a little like Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver.</p>

<p>I hope it is as good as 1 and 2. And that there is a character as good as Mona Sax.</p>

<p>Rockstar Games looks like a good game company. May be one day I can find a job there. LA Noire? Awesome.</p>
