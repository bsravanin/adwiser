GOALS
Why was an ad shown?
	Was it targeted on a D or a R/X?
	If targeted on a D, which D?


ASSUMPTIONS
Rs are rarely repeated across any accounts.


KNOWLEDGE
Some ads are targeted on Ds (emails).
Ratio of number of targeted ads and number of trials is a decreasing function.
Targeted ads are repeated across accounts with common Ds.
Xs are repeated across similar accounts even with no common Ds.


GRAPHS
Precision & Recall
	Fix trials based on knees of previous graph. Use max_trials if not possible.
	foreach (alpha, beta, model) threshold on x-axis.
	foreach (threshold, alpha, model) beta on x-axis.
	foreach (threshold, beta, model) alpha on x-axis.


TODOS
Number of targeted ads on Y-axis, number of trials on X-axis.
3. Prediction of all Ds above threshold and not just max_Ds: find precision and recall.
	Though precision will decrease as recall increases, the knee should have a somewhat high precision and recall simultaneously.
	Find alphas, betas, thresholds, models which give good precision and recall.
4. Reasons for bad precision and recall of targeted Vs untargeted:
	RULED OUT: Bad ad matching.
	Wrong assumptions. Validate or invalidate assumptions. What are the assumptions? How?
	Bad experimental setup. What is a better experiment setup? What mails in mailbox of real account? What division of mails in shadow accounts?
	Bad prediction and scoring. What makes a good scoring model for predictions?
5. Area under precision and recall curve is the efficiency of a model.
LOWPRI: Describe inputs and outputs along with the purpose for all functions.


DONE
1. Ad matching: find precision and recall.
	foreach (ad1, ad2), 1 if ads are same and 0 otherwise.
	90% precision and 80% recall is a good matching model.
	If good matching model, ignore ad matching.
	Matching with only exact match of AdURL/Text: 487 TPs, 53 FPs, 28 FNs
	Precision: 0.9018518518518519, Recall: 0.945631067961165
2. ads Vs trials graph.
	Knee around 33 trials for ccloudauditor10-30.
	Knees 3, 4 for ccloudauditor, ccloudauditor2.
3. Common ads in identical accounts.
4. Common ads in similar accounts.
