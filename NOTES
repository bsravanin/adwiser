GOALS
Why was an ad shown?
	Was it targeted on a D or a R/X?
	If targeted on a D, which D?


ASSUMPTIONS
If targeted on at least one email thread (found in ccloudauditor2* or not found in ccloudauditor1*): Ds
Else if targeted on os, browser, gmail, location, career, cars, money, music, future event (black friday): Xs
Else if rarely repeated with and across accounts: Rs

KNOWLEDGE
Some ads are targeted on Ds (emails).
Ratio of number of targeted ads and number of trials is a decreasing function.
Targeted ads are repeated across accounts with common Ds.
Xs are repeated across similar accounts even with no common Ds.


GRAPHS


TODOS
5. Selenium parallel. New set of trials?
6. Find the right alpha, beta, threshold for a model. Repeat for all models. (All alpha-beta combinations for a-b-c-d.)
7. Verify whether varying the number of trials -- mean(knees), median(knees), max(knees), max_trials -- impacts the results.

LOWPRI TODOS
2. What is a better experiment setup? What mails in mailbox of real account? What division of mails in shadow accounts?
3. What makes a good scoring model for predictions?
4. Area under precision and recall curve is the efficiency of a model.


DONE
1. Ad matching: find precision and recall.
	foreach (ad1, ad2), 1 if ads are same and 0 otherwise.
	90% precision and 80% recall is a good matching model.
	If good matching model, ignore ad matching.
	Matching with only exact match of AdURL/Text: 487 TPs, 53 FPs, 28 FNs
	Precision: 0.9018518518518519, Recall: 0.945631067961165
2. ads Vs trials graph.
	Knee around 33 trials for ccloudauditor10-30.
	Knees 3, 4 for ccloudauditor, ccloudauditor2.
3. Common ads in identical accounts.
4. Common ads in disjoint accounts.
5. Order by recall, not precision. Recall is a monotonic function. Precision is not.
6. Full truth, including types.
7. Targeted ads Vs Trials, TargetedX ads Vs Trials, Random Vs Trials graphs.
8. Ad types in identical accounts.
9. Verified whether varying the subset (or order) of trials varies the knee. (Say, in identical accounts.)
10. Cleanup page on disjoint accounts, including more useful graphs. One graph of all (1x, 2x) combinations and another of all (2x, 1x) combinations.
11. Various graphs, including precision Vs recall:
		foreach (alpha, beta, model) threshold on x-axis.
		foreach (threshold, alpha, model) beta on x-axis.
		foreach (threshold, beta, model) alpha on x-axis.
12. New disjoint accounts, threads, trials, truth, comparisons.
13. New models. p_exp equivalent to r_exp.

LOWPRI DONE
1. Describe args and returns along with the purpose for all functions.
